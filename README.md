lilypond-cheatsheets
====================

This a script for [LilyPond](http://www.lilypond.org/) that generates cheatsheets for fretted instruments. The cheatsheet contains all notes of the instrument on a note staff and a tab staff with note positions. In addition each note is named using scientific notation.

You can specify a tuning and the number of frets for your instrument.

[See the example](https://github.com/sg2002/lilypond-cheatsheets/blob/master/guitar-standard.pdf?raw=true) for 24 fret guitar in standard tuning.

Usage
------------------------

Download [cheatsheets.ly](https://github.com/sg2002/lilypond-cheatsheets/blob/master/cheatsheets.ly) and [cheatsheets-fns.scm](https://github.com/sg2002/lilypond-cheatsheets/blob/master/cheatsheets-fns.scm) in the same directory. Run cheatsheets.ly with lilypond.

If you are not familliar with lilypond, I recommend opening cheatsheets.ly with [Frescobaldi](http://www.frescobaldi.org/) editor.
